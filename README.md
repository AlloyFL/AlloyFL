# AlloyFL Latest Build
This github repo contains the latest build of AlloyFL as a pre-packaged JAR file.

The source code and example models can be found [here](https://github.com/AlloyFL/AlloyFLCode).

`AlloyFL` is an extension to the [Alloy Analyzer](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy) with support for fault localization. Given a faulty Alloy model (potentially with multiple faults) and a set of AUnit tests that capture the desired model properties, `AlloyFL` returns a ranked list of suspicious locations within the model that are likely to be faulty.
